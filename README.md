Welcome to the UF Alarm Clock Project! This innovative alarm clock is designed to revolutionize your mornings by incorporating unique features to ensure you wake up on time and stay alert.

## üöÄ Goal

The goal of the UF Alarm Clock project is to create an alarm clock that not only emulates all the features of a traditional alarm clock but also introduces novel functionalities to make waking up a more effective and engaging experience. Our aim is to provide users with the ability to configure various punishments for not waking up and implement innovative methods for detecting if a user is awake, thereby promoting better sleep habits and ensuring timely awakenings.

```
sudo apt install build-essential
// or...
xcode-select --install
```
